	 * 
	 * 
	 * Every block has has two methods, one that writes to a Writer and one that
	 * returns a String. It's important that the parent() function returns a
	 * string as it's part of an expression. Unfortunately we can't call
	 * super.block_blockname() which is the version that returns a String
	 * because THAT version actually calls the block_blockname(Writer writer)
	 * version which will end up being the overridden by the child class.
	 * Therefore we must instantiate an instance of the parent class which has
	 * no overridden block methods.
	 * 
	 * So instead of: 
	 * 	String result = super.block_blockName();
	 * 
	 * We have: 
	 * 	String result = (new ParentClass()).block_blockName();
	 * 
	 * Which is definitely a bit of a shame.
