#Pebble (Current Version: 0.0)
======

Pebble is a java templating engine. It started as a port of the [Twig templating engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for PHP.

Pebble is not even in an alpha stage. It is not yet ready for use.

## Roadmap

### Version 0.1
- tags: block, extends, filter, for, if, import, include, macro
- filters: capitalize, date, default, escape, format, json_encode, length, lower, number_format, trim, upper, url_encode
- functions: undetermined
- tests: empty, even, null, odd
- operators: in, is, +, -, /, *, %, and, or, not, (), ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, |, .
- extensive unit tests
- dedicated website and documentation

## Attribution

Pebble has been *highly* influenced by the [Twig templating engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for PHP so I extend a very large thanks to all developers who have contributed to that project.
